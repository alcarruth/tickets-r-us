     AWESOME

     Well done for making use of the flask-seasurf to implement the
     csrf_token to prevent the cross site request forgeries



line 130

     AWESOME

     Awesome! This is an impressive work to have the decorator fully used
     in your code to check User login status Ownership verification.

     Here is a comprehensive explanation regarding to the decorator,
     please consider to read about it.

line 180

     AWESOME

     Well done for this detail. csrf_token is only applicable in the
     form POST. Google/FB login/logout is out of the form POST, thus
     csrf.exempt is needed.



line 235

     SUGGESTION

     As suggested in last review, please consider to make sure that the
     special character / is handled properly.



line 249

     SUGGESTION

     It's great effort here to make the XML endpoint - however, the
     content-type in your response should be explicitly set to
     text/xml. Please look at here for the details.

     AWESOME

     Well done for making use of the flask upload to have the ticket
     images in the local file system.




line 353

     SUGGESTION

     Kindly note that the though you have given a path to the images
     that user is going to upload, the file has not actually stored in
     the local file system.

     Please make the following implementation to enhance the file upload:

     - Get the file name that the user is going to upload
     - Move the file to the destination folder on your server, i.e. images/tickets
     - Rename the file if necessary

     Please look at here for an example.

line 519

     AWESOME

     Well done for the consideration! Removing the ticket image - once
     the ticket is deleted.




google_auth.py
===============


line 77

     AWESOME

     Well done! Saving the access_token directly into the
     app_session to avoid the the potential Oauth2crendentail is not
     JSON serializable problem has been done correctly.



line 110

     SUGGESTION

     Please consider to delete the access token and other user
     information from the login session.

Project Review
================


API Endpoints
--------------

     SPECIFICATION

     Page implements an JSON endpoint with all required content.

     MEETS SPECIFICATION

     Reviewer Comments

     Kindly note that XML endpoint in current submission does not
     return the response in XML format due to the content-type not
     setting up correctly.





CRUD: Read
------------

     SPECIFICATION

     Page reads category and item information from a database.

     MEETS SPECIFICATION

     Reviewer Comments

     Great effort in your images implementation by embedding the flask
     file upload functionality.  However, in the ticket creation
     process, the image has not been saved on the server side. Please
     look at the code review section for the details.


     Requirements to exceed the specification 

     Page reads category and item information from a database. Student
     adds an item image field that is read from the database and
     displayed on the page.




CRUD: Create
--------------

     SPECIFICATION

     Page includes a form allowing users to add new items to the
     database table.

     MEETS SPECIFICATION

     SPECIFICATION

     Page correctly processes submitted forms.

     Reviewer Comments

     Well done for the check_authorization() and
     check_authentication() implementation and apply to the CRUD
     operation.

     Requirements to exceed the specification 

     Page correctly processes submitted forms. Student updates the new
     item form to correctly process the inclusion of item images.


CRUD: Update
--------------

     SPECIFICATION

     Page includes a function to edit/update a current record in the
     database table.

     MEETS SPECIFICATION

     SPECIFICATION

     Page correctly processes submitted forms.

     Reviewer Comments

     If the image is updated, please consider to make the
     implementation for deleting the original image and replace with
     the new image.

     Requirements to exceed the specification 

     Page correctly processes submitted forms. Student updates the
     edit/update item form to correctly process the inclusion of item
     images.


CRUD: Delete
--------------

     SPECIFICATION

     Page includes a function to delete a current record in the database table.

     EXCEEDS SPECIFICATION

     Reviewer Comments

     Great work here. CSRF_token has been implemented through the
     flask-seasurf.

     Requirements to exceed the specification 

     Page includes a function to delete a current record. Student
     researches and implements this function using POST requests and
     nonces to prevent cross-site request forgeries (CSRF).


Authentication & Authorization
-------------------------------

      SPECIFICATION

      Create, delete and update operations do consider authorization
      status prior to execution.

      MEETS SPECIFICATION

      Reviewer Comments

      Authorization and Authentication both verified prior to the
      CRUD execution.

      SPECIFICATION

      Page implements a third-party authentication & authorization
      service (like Google Accounts or Mozilla Persona) instead of
      implementing its own, insecure authentication & authorization
      spec.

      MEETS SPECIFICATION

      SPECIFICATION

      Make sure there is a 'Login' and 'Logout' button/link in the
      project. The aesthetics of this button/link is up to the
      discretion of the student.
