Code Review of first submission.

  If a user like me who is using the latest version of Flask, they
  would get the error similar to the following:

  TypeError: <oauth2client.client.OAuth2Credentials object at
  0x00000000039DBC88> is not JSON serializable

  In the terminal when they try and login with Google on your site.

  This is a common bug with the OAuth code provided by Udacity and is
  easily fixed by installing version 0.9 of Flask (pip install
  flask==0.9), which you could specify in the README.

  You can also fix the code and make it compatible with the latest
  version of Flask: The OAuth2Credentials object is not designed to be
  directly JSON serializable, so you have to use the methods to_json
  and from_json instead, which could be used to get the JSON for
  storage, i.e: app_session['credentials'] = credentials.to_json()

  You may consider to save the access_token directly into the
  app_session since the access_token will be used in the later stage
  of login.

  Status: done.

  I stored the access_token in app_session rather than
  the entire credentials object.

  REQUIRED

  Kindly note that your FB login app is still under development mode:

  "App Not Setup: This app is still in development mode, and you don't
  have access to it. Switch to a registered test user or ask an app
  admin for permissions."

  Please consider to switch your application from development mode to
  live mode - find the reference here about how to do so.



  Status: Done.

  The facebook app has been switched to live mode.

  SUGGESTION

  Please note that category_id, item_id are defined as the primary key
  for category and item, category_name, item_name has not been
  declared as unique identifiers for category and item.

  To preserve the database's integrity and prevent any duplicate
  category_name / item_name, please consider to add the UNIQUE
  constraint for these column in database_setup.py

  Moreover, please look at here for how to prevent the special
  characters entered by the user such like /

  http://flask.pocoo.org/snippets/76/

  Status: Done.

  I added 'unique=True' to a number of column declarations in
  tickets.py



  line 441

  SUGGESTION

  Please consider to have the data type included.

  Status: Done.

  I changed <user_id> (<game_id>, <ticket_lot_id> ...) to
  <int:user_id> ...

  SUGGESTION

  It’s awesome that you check if the user is signed in, I recommend
  you put this code into a Login Required Decorator. So for example
  your code would look something like this, though you would need to
  modify it to suit your app:

    def login_required(f):
        @wraps(f)
        def decorated_function(*args, **kwargs):
            if g.user is None:
                return redirect(url_for('login', next=request.url))
            return f(*args, **kwargs)
        return decorated_function

  and above each function that you need to be logged in to use:

    @login_required

  Here is a full explanation on how to implement it along with the
  code examples in the following link:

  http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.10/patterns/viewdecorators/

  The advantage of this, is of course you can avoid a lot of code
  repetition, it will be easier to tell at a glance which parts of
  your site is being protected and when you want to tweak your
  authentication, you will only need to edit one part of your code.


  Status: Done and then some !-)  

  I have added two decorator functions:

  check_authorization() and 
  check_authentication()

  Each takes a msg string as an arg.  When a check_auth...() fails,
  msg is flashed as the user is redirected appropriately.


  See sell_tickets(), edit_tickets() and delete_tickets() for example usage.



tickets.py

  SUGGESTION

  In order to keep the database's integrity, please consider to
  implement the ON DELETE CASCADE, which means when the category being
  referenced deleted, you need to delete the all the items belongs to
  it.

  Please look at here about how to do the implementation
  http://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/rel_0_9/orm/cascades.html


  Status:  done

Requirements
=============


  CRUD Requirements
  ==================

  READ
  -----

  Page reads category and item information from a database. Student
  adds an item image field that is read from the database and
  displayed on the page.

  CREATE
  -------
  Page correctly processes submitted forms. Student updates the new
  item form to correctly process the inclusion of item images.

  Added:
  <input type="hidden" name="_csrf_token" value="{{ csrf_token() }}">
  to form in the sell_tickets.html template.

  UPDATE
  -------

  Page correctly processes submitted forms. Student updates the
  edit/update item form to correctly process the inclusion of item
  images.

  Added:
  <input type="hidden" name="_csrf_token" value="{{ csrf_token() }}">
  to form in the  edit_tickets.html template.

  DELETE
  -------

  It would be better for all the POST request, you could include the
  csrf_token, flask-seasurf provides you some simple way for this
  improvement.

  Page includes a function to delete a current record. Student
  researches and implements this function using POST requests and
  nonces to prevent cross-site request forgeries (CSRF).

  Added:
  <input type="hidden" name="_csrf_token" value="{{ csrf_token() }}">
  to form in the  edit_tickets.html template.



  Authentication and Authorization
  ==================================

  Please kindly look at the code review section for how to avoid the
  Oauth2Credential is not JSON Serializable problem if the user is not
  using flask version 0.9.

  Moreover, please ensure your FB login is publicly accessible rather
  than in the development mode.

  Status: done.



  Documentation
  ===============

  In additional to the README, please consider to have the
  requirements.txt implemented so that user could install all the
  dependencies by following the required version.

  Please look at here for the details.
  https://pip.readthedocs.org/en/1.1/requirements.html



  Status: done.
  See requirements.txt and stable-req.txt.
